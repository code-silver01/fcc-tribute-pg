      <p>Once upon a Git-less time, there existed a naive soul who believed websites were built by dragging buttons into place. And that <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> meant “divide and conquer.”</p>

      <p>Their first project? A blinking, Comic Sans-fueled monstrosity. Their second project? Still blinking.</p>

      <p>Then came CSS. They discovered <code>margin: auto;</code> and used it like a hammer on every nail — yet nothing centered. Flexbox sounded like a protein supplement. Grid? Witchcraft.</p>

      <p>JavaScript brought a new flavor of pain. They asked, “What’s NaN?” The console replied: “Welcome to debugging.”</p>

      <p>But through the chaos, they evolved. From <code>console.log()</code> abuse to proper semicolon placement, they emerged... not perfect, but functional. Like a site that only breaks in IE11.</p>
